# Zip two linked lists together

## Feature Tasks

- Write a function called zip lists

  - Arguments: 2 linked lists
  - Return: Linked List, zipped as noted below
  - Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.
  - Try and keep additional space down to O(1)
  - You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges

## Example

zipLists(list1, list2)

- list1: head -> [1] -> [3] -> [2] -> X

- list2: head -> [5] -> [9] -> [4] -> X

- equals: head -> [1] -> [5] -> [3] -> [9] -> [2] -> [4] -> X
