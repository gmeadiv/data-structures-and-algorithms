# Reverse a Linked List

## Feature Tasks'

- Ask the candidate to write a function to reverse a Singly Linked List.

- Avoid utilizing any of the built-in methods available in your language.

- Attempt to guide the candidate to an in-place solution (i.e. avoid creating a copy of the Linked List)

This problem can be approached in several ways:
Iterating over the linked list and storing a reference to a current node, its previous node, and its next node.
In every iteration, after the next node is stored, the currentâ€™s node next pointer is pointed at the stored reference to the previous node.

## Example

- Input | Output

  - head->[3]->[2]->[1] | head->[1]->[2]->[3]
  - head->['a']->['b']->['c'] | head->['c']->['b']->['a']
