# Pseudoqueueing with Stacks

## Feature Tasks

- Create a new class called pseudo queue.
  - Do not use an existing Queue.
Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
  - Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue
- Methods:
  - Enqueue: inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
  - Dequeue: extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach

- NOTE: The Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods. You should use your own Stack implementation. Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.
