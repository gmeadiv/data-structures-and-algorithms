# Animal Shelter

## Feature Tasks

- Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
- Implement the following methods:
  - enqueue: animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
  - dequeue: pref can be either "dog" or "cat"
    - Return: either a dog or a cat, based on preference.
    - If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## Stretch Goal

If a cat or dog isnâ€™t preferred, return whichever animal has been waiting in the shelter the longest.
